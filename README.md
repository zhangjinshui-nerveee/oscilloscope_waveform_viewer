# Oscilloscope Waveform Viewer

After saving waveform files from oscilloscopes, this software provide an easy way to view them.
This project starts from a normal bench oscilloscope Tektronix MDO3054, which saves .csv files. 
More types of oscilloscopes and file formats will be updated in the future.
